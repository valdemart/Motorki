# - ready for tests
? - possibly to do
! - important note
. - just note

- game
	- local two player game options removed from project
	- splitscreen options removed from project
	- all game types unlocked
	- default game limits in new game
	- corrects in winning/losing functions - now should work perfectly for won/tied/lost results
- bots
	- bot sophistication controls in new game screen
	- GamePlay almost connected (GamePlay->agents notifications left to be created)
	- BotMotor learned to start agent
- maps
	- test what will happen if many motors spawn at the same place&time
		- motors crashed each other and sometimes some bugs happened
		- categorized as bug and fixed
		- motors still will destroy each other if they are enemies

todo:
+ connecting
	+ cancel
+ maps
	+ notify map loading progress to loading screen
	+ drawing to split screen part (to be done when GamePlayScreen will be available)
	+ more maps
+ minimap
+ textures
	+ bonus textures
? add animations into UIClasses controls
* networking
	+ read bot sophistication, connected count and max count in EnumerateServers
	+ NetPlayerMotor class
+ audio support
* finish implementing game menus and screens
	+ partially need: networking (for JoinGame support - NewGame can work in offline if it needs)
	? need: anchors in UIControl
	+ New game - push to Loading screen
	+ game play init: split screen and two player support
+ game
	+ unlock team game modes
	* GamePlay class (game progress processor; also network client)
	+ bonus storage (map contains bonus accessibility for game; server generates bonusses)
	* collision detection
		+ rebounds (change algorithm)
	* UI
		+ frag/point counters
			+ team notifications
			# demolition notifications (counter should show how many of all motors is still alive)
		+ party members
		+ split screen
	# game types (implementation)
	+ check team spawn obtaining method
? UI: move state shifting to switch-case scheme (instead of ?: scheme) - state machines for documentation
? UI: lock unused properties accessibility
? UI: anchors
<engineer>
+ bots
	+ bot sophistication normal/hard
		* todo: implement agent actions
	+ connect in GamePlay game initialization routines (need additional GameSettings field)
		* todo: GamePlay tells to all agents that game started or finished
	. in higher sophistication MindProc routines don't need to delegate GameTime information to the BotAgent routines
		. agents can get time from MotorkiGame.game.currentTime
		! agent should copy current time if it needs to use it more that once - Update can occur while agent is thinking about its own decisions
	! need some agent description format
	! need some tactics for bots (defensive, offensive, cooperatively offensive)
		! need some communication for bots to use during cooperatives
+ UIClasses
	+ event cancellation through event.GetInvokationList()
